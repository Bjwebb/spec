## Building blocks

### Sections and structure

The fundamental building block of the Social Finance Data Specification is a **deal**.

Deals may comprise one or more forms of finance, typically a **grant**, a **loan**, and/or **equity**.

Grants are a form of non-repayable finance while loans and equity are usually paid back by the recipient, often with interest.

Deals with multiple elements of repayable and non-repayable finance are sometimes referred to as "blended finance".

.. admonition:: For example

  Example 1. A social investment deal worth £20,000 made up of one element:  
    * A £20,000 loan from a funding organsiation, to be repaid over 10 years at 4.5% interest.

  Example 2. A social investment deal worth £30,000 is made up of:  
    * £15,000 of share capital raised by the recipient organisation through equity from a community shares offer; and,  
    * a £15,000 match funded grant from a funding organisation.  

  Example 3. A social investment deal worth £50,000 is made up of:  
    * a £10,000 grant from Funder A, which has been used as leverage for  
    * a £40,000 loan from Funder B, repaid over 5 years at 3% interest.  

```

A deal will entered into by a number of parties, typically the **funding** organisation or organisations (one of whom is the **coordinator**) and the **recipient** organisation (or organisations).

Each of the funding organisations provide one or more elements of the deal's finance, and the equity element may be provided by a large number of organisations and individiuals (for example, a community shares issue).
