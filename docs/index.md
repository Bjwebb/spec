Social Finance Data Specification (Alpha)
==============================
```eval_rst
.. attention::
    **This documentation site is a work in progress.**

    The Social Finance Data Specification is being developed as a draft data specification for describing social investment. For more information contact jack.lord@opendataservices.coop or bob.harper@opendataservices.coop

```

For open data to be really useful it has to follow an agreed format – a standard – so that data from many publishers can be compared.

For the social investment market, we have developed the social investment data specification for this purpose. We use this specification to make sure that when all your data is made available online, it can be easily “read” by different applications.

This is how we make sure that when you use the data, the results that come up can be compared.

The social investment data specification is:

* **Open data driven**: providing a common way to share transparent and interoperable information on social investment.
* **Easy to use**: offering a simple spreadsheet format for publishing and consuming data, backed up by a structured data model, developer-friendly JSON serialisation, and conversion tools.
* **Comprehensive**: delivering a full view of social investment. Describing the whole investment process and supporting the in-depth analysis of deals, grants, loans and beneficiaries.
